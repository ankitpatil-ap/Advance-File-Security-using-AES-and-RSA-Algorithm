# Advance-File-Security-using-AES-and-RSA-Algorithm
This is version 1 of the project, which has the complete flow of encryption and decryption.
Django Web App using AES and RSA Algorithm on which you encrypt or decrypt single/multiple files with advance level of encryption and security...

Read Steps file and then run the project.

Two Algorithms are used here for file encryption and decryption are as follows :

1) Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is widely used today as it is much stronger than DES and triple DES despite being harder to implement.
Points to remember 

2) RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private. 
An example of asymmetric cryptography :
1.	A client (for example, a browser) sends its public key to the server and requests for some data.
2.	The server encrypts the data using client’s public key and sends the encrypted data.
3.	The client receives this data and decrypts it.

Applications: -

•	Through encryption, AFS helps protect sensitive files from hackers or data thieves who gain unauthorized access to a computing network or devices.
•	Commercial Companies which need to deal with third party companies for project contracts need a system where data cannot be steeled or modified.
•	To Share files among trusted clients over any social network where hackers cannot decrypt the file.

I am now adding more features to this web app. It's like face unlock.
